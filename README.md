# python-api-challenge
## Overview
This challenge consisted of creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, using pandas, matplotlib, and gmaps.
## Data
Data was retreived from the OpenWeatherMap API for a sample of cities. And the Google API was used to find hotel data nearest to those cities.

## Analysis & Conclusion
There is a strong correlation between the maximum forecasted temperature and degrees latitude of a given city. This relationship was stronger for the northern hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. Cities near the equator experience more exposure to the sun throughout out the year.
