# python-api-challenge
## Overview
This challenge consisted of creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, using pandas, matplotlib, and gmaps.
## Data
Data was retreived from the OpenWeatherMap API for a sample of cities. And the Google API was used to find hotel data nearest to those cities.

## Analysis & Conclusion
There is a strong correlation between the maximum forecasted temperature and degrees latitude of a given city. This relationship was stronger for the northern hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. Cities near the equator experience more exposure to the sun throughout out the year.

The heat map showed the coastal areas and some dry inland regions which have higher humidity due to evaporation near the bodies of water. The drier regions experience it when there are thunderstorms, and the change in humidity happens when the storms clear up. Meanwhile coasral regions experience high humidity.
